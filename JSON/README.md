# JSON Semi-Structured Data Handling in Snowflake

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to handle and process semi-structured JSON data in Snowflake, including ingesting, querying, and transforming JSON data in a Snowflake environment.


## Features

- Ingestion of JSON Data: Loading JSON data into Snowflake tables.
- Flattening JSON Structures: Using Snowflake's VARIANT, OBJECT, and ARRAY data types to handle nested JSON structures.
- Data Transformation: Example SQL queries to extract and transform nested data into a structured format.
- Querying Semi-Structured Data: Techniques to efficiently query JSON data within Snowflake.


## Prerequisites
- Snowflake account (Free trial or paid).
- Snowflake CLI (snowflake-cli) or SnowSQL for executing commands.
- Sample JSON files for loading and testing.
## Setup Instructions
### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-semi-structured-data-snowflake.git

cd json-semi-structured-data-snowflake

### Create Snowflake Database and Schema Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary database and schema in Snowflake:

-- Example SQL to create database and schema

CREATE DATABASE semi_structured_data;
CREATE SCHEMA json_schema;

### Load JSON Data into Snowflake

Place your JSON files in a Snowflake stage (internal or external).
Use the following command to load the data:

COPY INTO @your_stage 
FROM 'path/to/your/json/file.json'
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON');

### Querying JSON Data

Example SQL queries to interact with the loaded JSON data:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
  data:field_name::string AS field_name
FROM 
  json_schema.your_table
WHERE 
  data:field_name::string = 'desired_value';

### Example Use Cases
- Extracting specific fields from deeply nested JSON structures.
- Analyzing JSON data by flattening nested arrays or objects into tabular format.
- Transforming semi-structured data into structured Snowflake tables.
